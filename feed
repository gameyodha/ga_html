				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the game that Poland’s studio CD Projekt Red has been making good game for a while now, ever since it debuted this dark fantasy series, based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski, in 2007.</p>

<p>Wild Hunt is a majestic, earthy open-world adventure with great integrity and personality, this is the best role-playing game in years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/the_witcher_3/The_witcher_3_003.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Wild Hunt is the masterpiece of lving, breathing world with great rich and fetile landscape. Sunset is orange with storm clouds, making enviornment more real with lashed winds and rain. Every part of the landcape is detailed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/the_witcher_3/The_witcher_3_001.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Geralt of Rivia, a witcher is the main character and freelancue monster slayer with mutant blood who usees silver swords, alchemy and some times magic. Some he is also a ladies man. He wanders town to town on his horse with his own agenda of doing good and helped those who seeks his help. Some times he will get good amount, some times will just do for fun. His life completly surrounded by political unstabily , amy leader for kings and some time his fellow sorcerers friends. Most important his own complicated LOVE LIFE <img class="wp-smiley" src="file:///D:/Projects/GameAstra/Website/www.gameastra.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/the_witcher_3/The_witcher_3_002.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="720" /></p>
<p>Combat is much streamlined then previous one and tutorials are good like combat strikes, dodges and counter with gadgets and magical attacks. Postions are great in healing and giving you extra ability but some postions raise you toxicity. Give Geralt more strength with performing upgrade the skill tree or what ever path you choose.</p>
<p>Witcher 3 world is realy huge, it is larger than watch dogs, Assassin’s creed Unity and GTA V.<br />
There are few loading screens like when game starts and ends or selecting some missions. Town feels like actual towns, rather than populated with same models.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/the_witcher_3/The_witcher_3_010.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Witcher 3 running good with Nvidia Card, while on AMD Card it less pleasent.<br />
Nevertheless game is great from story point and graphics point. I suggest play The Witcher 1 and 2 which give you understanding for Geralt. Some newcomer feels confuse but the bigger picture of game-play is always clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p>After realised, some of the player who have Windows User Accounts contain certain Characters are having problems installing or playing GTAV. This Issues include an error message saying “The Rockstar update service is unavailable (code 1)”, or the game hanging while trying to download the update. Rockstar <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204772198-How-to-Fix-Problems-Installing-or-Playing-GTAV-PC-On-Windows-User-Accounts-Containing-Certain-Characters">responce</a> that they are currently working on this Issue.</p>
<p>Teams says “If you don’t want to wait for a fix, you need to create a new <strong>Administrator</strong> User Account for your Windows system that only includes letters A to Z, a to z or numbers 0-9 from the basic roman alphabet. For a full list of supported characters, see the table at the bottom of this page. Please note that simply renaming your current User Account will not correct this issue. Once your new account is created (or if you already have an account that only uses these characters) we recommend you restart your PC and log in with that account before starting or continuing with the installation process”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NetherRealm’s fighting game Mortal Kombat X will launch worldwide on April 14, 2015. The game is coming to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS and Android. PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have been delayed to June 2. It is most brutal and violent game. Its fatalities are gruesome, depicting severed heads, ripped-out ribs, and other bloody affairs. But the violence is meant to be fantastical and not realistic, lead game designer John Edwards says.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/mortal_kombat_x/fight.jpg" alt="" width="1279" height="720" /></p>
<p>New for Mortal Kombat X is the variations system, ways of tweaking the capabilities of characters in unique ways. Every one of the 14 characters we were shown during the studio visit had three unique variations. While the majority of the moveset between variations of the same character was the same, each variation had unique capabilities that colored the way they fought.”The variation system adds a lot of cool competitive stuff to the game,” Edwards said. Say that you allow your opponent to pick their character first. After they’ve made their selection, “you can counter-pick different variations.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Violence is meant to be fantastical and not realistic</p></blockquote>
<p>“We can punch holes in pretty much any part of the body that we want to,” he said. “The tech has allowed us to do a bunch of crazy stuff that we’ve never been able to do before.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/mortal_kombat_x/mk_u.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="720" /></p>
<p>While a variety of familiar faces will return to the game’s initial release, a handful of newcomers will also be featured as well. Some classic characters who have been seen in trailers, such as Smoke and Baraka, might not be unlockable. Rather, they could be scheduled as DLC sometime in the future. Regardless, you can find a full list of the initial release below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cassie Cage</li>
<li>D’Vorah</li>
<li>Ermac</li>
<li>Erron Black</li>
<li>Ferra &amp; Torr</li>
<li>Goro</li>
<li>Jacqueline Briggs</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming on pc after 17 months of long waiting time, and guess what PC is getting the ultimate version of the Rockstar open-world. Demo from the Rockstar show the game in 4K resolution running at 60fps. Rockstar says that even average rigs won’t have a problem getting great 1080p performance out of the game, which is good for the average players. We hope the PC edition will prove to be the definitive, most graphically polished edition of the game.</p>
<blockquote><p>All the effects that compose our lighting (reflection, ambient occlusion, skin and post effect) are higher quality and higher resolution</p></blockquote>
<p>“It is the overall experience that adds to that feeling,” explains the team. “With each iteration of the game we’ve been able to push the quality level of the effects that support the lighting, while the lighting itself hasn’t actually changed much since the PS3/Xbox 360 version.”</p>
<p>“All the effects that compose our lighting (reflection, ambient occlusion, skin and post effect) are higher quality and higher resolution (where settings permit), which gives the PC version a smoother and more nuanced picture.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_007.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>The Rockstar North team explains there were plenty of difficulties taking a game with the girth of GTA V from the one-size-fits-all world of consoles and making it behave itself in an environment where it needs to scale itself based on the pc hardware combinations different players may have, but they made sure they had the time to address them.</p>
<p>“We had prepared for PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions so we could rebuild the map at higher fidelity for each platform,” says the team. “And we do normally use scaling to dial some aspects of the game so we can fine-tune the game’s look and performance – that was in part already present in GTA on PS3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>“One of the goals with GTA V on PC was to be sure that PC players at all levels could get something exciting out of the experience, and that was a factor in all of our decision-making,” says the team. “As we have said before, we are not in the business of making or selling hardware – we want everyone to be able to experience the games we make.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_006.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>“The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is the result of a collaboration between the core Grand Theft Auto team and our lead PC developers from across all of Rockstar’s studios,” explains the Rockstar North team. “Over the past few years, we realised that in order to really improve our PC versions, the core games team had to work a lot more closely with our PC-focused developers.”</p>
<p>“We also spent a lot of time ensuring the keyboard and mouse controls have been extensively thought through. And of course there is the Rockstar Editor, which really opens up the mechanics of the game and makes a ton of variables available to the player, which required a huge amount of work.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_012.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Another new feature being added to PC GTA 5 is the Rockstar Editor. It will provide a complete set of editing tools for “recording, staging and editing original custom videos” in-game. You’ll be able to add soundtracks to these custom clips using music from debut radio station The Lab, which can then be published directly to Rockstar’s Social Club and YouTube</p>
<p>PC GTA 5 also getting the Director Mode will allow us to stage elaborate scenes and control characters and animals, adjust weather and time of day on the fly, and trigger actions like gestures and dialogue phrases. Players will also be able to warp to different locations around the map and activate in-game cheats. Rockstar confirms animals, special pedestrians and heist crew members will unlock for use here as you progress through the single-player game.</p>
<p>Stay with us more info on GTA 5. Prepare to play GTA 5 on April 14, check the System Requirement if your System is ready for that.</p>
