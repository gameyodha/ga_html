<p>New for Mortal Kombat X is the variations system, ways of tweaking the capabilities of characters in unique ways. Every one of the 14 characters we were shown during the studio visit had three unique variations. While the majority of the moveset between variations of the same character was the same, each variation had unique capabilities that colored the way they fought.”The variation system adds a lot of cool competitive stuff to the game,” Edwards said. Say that you allow your opponent to pick their character first. After they’ve made their selection, “you can counter-pick different variations.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Violence is meant to be fantastical and not realistic</p></blockquote>
<p>“We can punch holes in pretty much any part of the body that we want to,” he said. “The tech has allowed us to do a bunch of crazy stuff that we’ve never been able to do before.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/mortal_kombat_x/mk_u.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="720" /></p>
<p>While a variety of familiar faces will return to the game’s initial release, a handful of newcomers will also be featured as well. Some classic characters who have been seen in trailers, such as Smoke and Baraka, might not be unlockable. Rather, they could be scheduled as DLC sometime in the future. Regardless, you can find a full list of the initial release below:</p>

<li>Cassie Cage</li>
<li>D’Vorah</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming on pc after 17 months of long waiting time, and guess what PC is getting the ultimate version of the Rockstar open-world. Demo from the Rockstar show the game in 4K resolution running at 60fps. Rockstar says that even average rigs won’t have a problem getting great 1080p performance out of the game, which is good for the average players. We hope the PC edition will prove to be the definitive, most graphically polished edition of the game.</p>
<blockquote><p>All the effects that compose our lighting (reflection, ambient occlusion, skin and post effect) are higher quality and higher resolution</p></blockquote>
<p>“It is the overall experience that adds to that feeling,” explains the team. “With each iteration of the game we’ve been able to push the quality level of the effects that support the lighting, while the lighting itself hasn’t actually changed much since the PS3/Xbox 360 version.”</p>
<p>“All the effects that compose our lighting (reflection, ambient occlusion, skin and post effect) are higher quality and higher resolution (where settings permit), which gives the PC version a smoother and more nuanced picture.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_007.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>The Rockstar North team explains there were plenty of difficulties taking a game with the girth of GTA V from the one-size-fits-all world of consoles and making it behave itself in an environment where it needs to scale itself based on the pc hardware combinations different players may have, but they made sure they had the time to address them.</p>
<p>“We had prepared for PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions so we could rebuild the map at higher fidelity for each platform,” says the team. “And we do normally use scaling to dial some aspects of the game so we can fine-tune the game’s look and performance – that was in part already present in GTA on PS3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>“One of the goals with GTA V on PC was to be sure that PC players at all levels could get something exciting out of the experience, and that was a factor in all of our decision-making,” says the team. “As we have said before, we are not in the business of making or selling hardware – we want everyone to be able to experience the games we make.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_006.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>“The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is the result of a collaboration between the core Grand Theft Auto team and our lead PC developers from across all of Rockstar’s studios,” explains the Rockstar North team. “Over the past few years, we realised that in order to really improve our PC versions, the core games team had to work a lot more closely with our PC-focused developers.”</p>
<p>“We also spent a lot of time ensuring the keyboard and mouse controls have been extensively thought through. And of course there is the Rockstar Editor, which really opens up the mechanics of the game and makes a ton of variables available to the player, which required a huge amount of work.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img.gameastra.com/gta5/gta5_012.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Another new feature being added to PC GTA 5 is the Rockstar Editor. It will provide a complete set of editing tools for “recording, staging and editing original custom videos” in-game. You’ll be able to add soundtracks to these custom clips using music from debut radio station The Lab, which can then be published directly to Rockstar’s Social Club and YouTube</p>
<p>PC GTA 5 also getting the Director Mode will allow us to stage elaborate scenes and control characters and animals, adjust weather and time of day on the fly, and trigger actions like gestures and dialogue phrases. Players will also be able to warp to different locations around the map and activate in-game cheats. Rockstar confirms animals, special pedestrians and heist crew members will unlock for use here as you progress through the single-player game.</p>
<p>Stay with us more info on GTA 5. Prepare to play GTA 5 on April 14, check the System Requirement if your System is ready for that.</p>
